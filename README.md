bootstrap dropdown-typeahead extension for typeahead search bar 
===========================================

We have created an extension that lets you copy the entered input value to first of dropdown list. 
When press enter it will search entered text instead of first auto-complete result.

This is not a complete extension but it lets you do the job without changing bootstrap.js :)

Just use the js code in the header. Give data as an array in line 29.

To have a idea what is look like : http://a1211.hizliresim.com/13/9/fsgbb.png
