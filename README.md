<h2>Bootstrap dropdown(typeahead) extension for typeahead search bar.</h2>
===========================================

We have created an extension that lets you copy the entered input value to first of dropdown list. 
When press enter it will search entered text instead of first auto-complete result.

This is not a complete extension but it lets you do the job without changing bootstrap.js :)

Just use the js code in the header. Give data as an array in line 29.
